Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation.

Soon she realized that they came to her from within.<br><br>Glennon was finally hearing her own voice\u2014the voice that had been silenced by decades of cultural conditioning, numbing addictions, and institutional allegiances.

She decided to build a life of her own\u2014one based on her individual desire, intuition, and imagination. She would reclaim her true, untamed self.<br><br>Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, <i>Untamed</i> is both a memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It offers a piercing, electrifying examination of the restrictive expectations women are issued from birth; shows how hustling to meet those expectations leaves women feeling dissatisfied and lost; and reveals that when we quit abandoning ourselves and instead abandon the world\u2019s expectations of us, we become women who can finally look at ourselves and recognize: <i>There She Is</i>.<br><br><i>Untamed</i> shows us how to be brave.
