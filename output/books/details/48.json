Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation.

As powerful men and women around her became victims of Henry\u2019s ruthless and absolute power, including her own husband and sister-in-law, Queen Anne Boleyn, Jane\u2019s allegiance to the volatile monarchy was sustained and rewarded. But the price for her loyalty would eventually be her undoing and the ruination of her name. For centuries, little beyond rumor and scandal has been associated with \u201cthe infamous Lady Rochford.\u201d But now historian Julia Fox sets the record straight and restores dignity to this much-maligned figure whose life and reputation were taken from her.<br><br>Born to aristocratic parents in the English countryside, young Jane Parker found a suitable match in George Boleyn, brother to Anne, the woman who would eventually be the touchstone of England\u2019s greatest political and religious crisis. Once settled in the bustling, spectacular court of Henry VIII as the wife of a nobleman, Jane was privy to the regal festivities of masques and jousts, royal births and funerals, and she played an intimate part in the drama and gossip that swirled around the king\u2019s court. <br><br>But it was Anne Boleyn\u2019s descent from palace to prison that first thrust Jane into the spotlight.

Despite being left permanently disabled, she remained 'quite fearless', becoming skilled at driving and riding horses, and was determined to rise above the physical challenges of the world before her. She became heavily involved in practical charity work, taught children and adults and travelled abroad for her health - at one spa striking up a friendship with Tennyson.<br>Driven by a strong faith, and resolute in character, it was Anna's indignation upon witnessing cruelty to animals which led her to write <i>Black Beauty</i> - 'its special aim, ' she wrote, 'being to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.'

Already hailed by the London <i>Observer</i> as \"one of the most significant British novelists of her generation,\" Ali has written a stunningly accomplished debut about one outsider's quest to find her voice. <br> <i>What could not be changed must be borne. And since nothing could be changed, everything had to be borne. This principle ruled her life. It was mantra, fettle, and challenge.</i> <br> Nazneen's inauspicious entry into the world, an apparent stillbirth on the hard mud floor of a village hut, imbues in her a sense of fatalism that she carries across continents when she is married off to Chanu, a man old enough to be her father. Nazneen moves to London and, for years, keeps house, cares for her husband, and bears children, just as a girl from the village is supposed to do. But gradually she is transformed by her experience, and begins to question whether fate controls her or whether she has a hand in her own destiny. <br> Motherhood is a catalyst -- Nazneen's daughters chafe against their father's traditions and pride -- and to her own amazement, Nazneen falls in love with a young man in the community. She discovers both the complexity that comes with free choice and the depth of her attachment to her husband, her daughters, and her new world. <br> While Nazneen journeys along her path of self-realization, her sister, Hasina, rushes headlong at her life, first making a \"love marriage,\" then fleeing her violent husband. Woven through the novel, Hasina's letters from Dhaka recount a world of overwhelming adversity. Shaped, yet not bound, by their landscapes and memories, both sisters struggle to dream -- and live -- beyond the rules prescribed for them. <br> Vivid, profoundly humane, and beautifully rendered, <i>Brick Lane</i> captures a world at once unimaginable and achingly familiar.

For over twenty years, the three lived together in a jealous and uneasy m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, during which time both women bore the Duke's children\u2014as well as those of other men.<br><br>Foreman's descriptions of Georgiana's uncontrollable gambling, all-night drinking, drug taking, and love affairs with the leading politicians of the day give us fascinating insight into the lives of the British aristocracy in the era of the madness of King George III, the American and French revolutions, and the defeat of Napoleon. <br><br>A gifted young historian whom critics are already likening to Antonia Fraser, Amanda Foreman draws on a wealth of fresh research and writes colorfully and penetratingly about the fascinating Georgiana, whose struggle against her own weaknesses, whose great beauty and flamboyance, and whose determination to play a part in the affairs of the world make her a vibrant, astonishingly contemporary figure.</p>", "title": "Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire", "ratingValue": "3.81", "authors": "Amanda Foreman", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332041559l/319300.jpg"}, "9780750986991": {"genres": ["Biography", "History", "Nonfiction", "European Literature", "British Literature"], "isbn": "9780750986991", "description": "Margaret, Duchess of Argyll (1912-1993) was an international celebrity in her youth, adored and observed by millions. But in 1963, the year of the Profumo Affair, the 11th Duke of Argyll shocked the country when he alleged that his adulterous wife had slept with over eighty men behind his back. He produced, as his evidence, a set of sexually explicit Polaroid photographs and explosive love letters. The duke won a divorce, but this had a dramatic effect on Margaret's life. On the verge of financial destitution, she fell from grace and was abandoned by most of her friends prior to her death in a nursing home in Pimlico in 1993. Lyndsy Spence tells a tragic story of the life and downfall of this fascinatingly complex woman, and shows how she fell victim to a cruel husband, harsh social mores and an unforgiving class. It uses hitherto unpublished sources, including taped conversations, an unexpurgated transcript of her divorce trial, interviews and letters. The Grit in the Pearl is a meticulously researched and powerful biography, which acts as a potent lens on various themes in the last century: fame, privacy, the media, sex, power, and relationships between classes.", "title": "The Grit in the Pearl: The Scandalous Life of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll", "ratingValue": "3.52", "authors": "Lyndsy Spence", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549836542l/43544824.jpg"}}
