Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence.

CHOICES challenges the reader to do something counterintuitive and revolutionary in today's outcome-oriented culture: Intend the choices you make. Operating on autopilot, our choices are made by default. The choices we make mimic the breaths we take-voluntary deep breaths and involuntary shallow ones. We make choices every second of the day. Intent puts things in perspective and keeps the present in plain view. Intent enhances all that we experience. CHOICES 86,400 a day is the residue of a journey that emanated from an age-old admonition: Think about what you are doing. A passionate pursuit of a vigorous, intentional way of being was the driving force in the writing of CHOICES. Most of my life, my focus was fixed on the endgame, never the process. Going through the motions, I used the present to prepare for the future until I figured out that my achievement-eating ego was running the show. All I was really doing was accruing regrets for all the opportunities that had expired. CHOICES 86,400 a day exposes the underbelly of ordinary circumstances, retrieves discoveries we discard and uncovers an ever-present option: intended choices. In this increasingly accelerated era of multitasking, CHOICES is chock-full of observations relevant to each and every individual in the throes of one endeavor after another.", "title": "Choices 86,400 a day", "ratingValue": "3.96", "authors": "Lauren  Alexander", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334878483l/13113312.jpg"}, "9780553279375": {"genres": ["Nonfiction", "Classics", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Biography", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Poetry", "Feminism", "Cultural", "African American", "Biography Memoir", "Race"], "isbn": "9780553279375", "description": "Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local \"powhitetrash.\" At eight years old and back at her mother\u2019s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age\u2014and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime.
