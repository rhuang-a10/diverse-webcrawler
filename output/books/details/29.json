Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken. Shah asks and attempts to answer the question: How do you move in such a way that loss does not limit you? <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> introduces a vital new voice to the conversation about race and belonging in America.", "title": "This Is One Way to Dance: Essays", "ratingValue": "4.57", "authors": "Sejal Shah", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585166374l/53033965.jpg"}, "9780552137645": {"genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Romance", "Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Adult", "Space", "Space", "Space Opera", "Science Fiction", "Aliens"], "isbn": "9780552137645", "description": "", "title": "Damia", "ratingValue": "4.01", "authors": "Anne McCaffrey", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408926315l/61959.jpg"}, "9780345470034": {"genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Space", "Adult", "Audiobook", "Space", "Space Opera", "Sci Fi Fantasy"], "isbn": "9780345470034", "description": "With three acclaimed novels\u2013Powers That Be, Power Lines, and Power Play\u2013bestselling authors Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough launched a vibrant new science-fiction saga that told the story of a sentient planet, Petaybee, and the humans who fought to protect it from the rapacious designs of an all-powerful interstellar corporation determined to exploit the icy world\u2019s natural resources.

As the only female apprentices, Nonala and Kelsa are the butt of jokes and easy targets for the bully Vaxoram and his cronies.

Arising suddenly, as if out of nowhere, the contagion decimates hold after hold, paying no heed to distinctions of birth.

As Acorna and her Linyaari people begin to rebuild their home planet (which was practically destroyed by the evil insectoid Khleevi in Acorna's World), members of Linyaarian research parties begin to disappear one by one. Soon whole shuttles are just vanishing into thin air. Among the missing is Acorna's life mate, Aari. After consulting with the Ancestors, Acorna concludes that she must go deep underneath the planet's surface to solve the potentially horrific mystery.<p><br>\tThe once cool, idyllic world of Vhiliinyar is now like something out of a nightmare. \"The whole planet was, for the most part, stifling, with much of its protective ozone layer punctured by volcanic explosions and toxic chemical reactions from its unstable land masses and destroyed seas.\" Instead of green meadows filled with beautiful flora and fauna, there are now carnivorous plants, poisonous geysers, bogs and apelike monsters. While trying to escape these hairy, spear-toting beasts, Acorna is forced deep into a cave and stumbles across the opening into an ancient subterranean city.</p><p> <br>\tThe mysterious history of the uni-horned Linyaari people is steeped in fable, and when Acorna discovers the mythical city of Kubiilikaan, the legendary home of the Hosts, much of what she thought was historically true becomes suspect. As Acorna unravels the mystery with the help of the royal temple cat Roadkill and Mac the android, she finds out Aari isn't lost in space, but in time.</p><p> <br>\tFor those of you who aren't familiar with the series, here's a quick overview. In the first book in the series, <i>Acorna,</i> we're introduced to the lovable orphan after her family's spaceship is mysteriously destroyed. She escapes in a space pod and is found by a salvage ship crewed by three humans. The men had never seen anything quite like Acorna before. The Linyaari were a race of humanoids with unicorn characteristics -- a flowing, curling mane and feathery hair from ankle to knee, hooves, three fingers and, of course, a horn protruding from their foreheads.</p><p> <br>\tThe men, obviously with nowhere to take the orphan, are forced to raise the strange girl themselves. During their months aboard ship, they bond with the lovable kid and she slowly learns their language and culture. But with none of her kind around, and no way to know if any even still exist, Acorna struggles to find her own identity. When the salvage ship finally returns to Federation space, Acorna becomes the center of attention. Rumors spread like wildfire about a unicorn girl with magical powers.</p><p><br>\tOver the course of the next two novels (<i>Acorna's Quest</i> and <i>Acorna's People</i>), Acorna finds the Linyaari homeworld and becomes reunited with her people. She learns about her race's history and culture and also about its enemies, the Khleevi. I have to tell you, the Khleevi are right up there on my Top Ten list of most despicable aliens. They're basically oversized cockroaches that travel the galaxy looking for worlds to plunder and life forms to torture.</p><p><br>\tIn <i>Acorna's World,</i> the fourth installment, Acorna and her people come face-to-face with the Khleevi, except this time they have the Federation's help. </p><p><br>\tI recommend this series to fantasy lovers of all ages. McCaffrey and Scarborough (who coauthored the last three books in the series) create an interesting, realistic world without exploitative sex or violence. And, because the main character is a young, strong, good-hearted female, this series would be particularly perfect for young girls interested in fantasy. <br> <i>(Paul Goat Allen)</i></p>", "title": "Acorna's Search", "ratingValue": "3.77", "authors": "Anne McCaffrey", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390187327l/829807.jpg"}, "9780345468635": {"genres": ["Fantasy", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Historical", "Mythology", "Arthurian", "Animals", "Horses"], "isbn": "9780345468635", "description": "\"This fast-moving historical fantasy by bestselling author Anne McCaffrey traces the beginnings of the British cavalry, as recounted by a boy growing up in exciting and perilous times. <br>\"After his father's death, young Galwyn Varianus is apprenticed to his uncle, who puts the boy to work on the high seas.
