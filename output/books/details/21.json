Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken. Shah asks and attempts to answer the question: How do you move in such a way that loss does not limit you? <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> introduces a vital new voice to the conversation about race and belonging in America.", "title": "This Is One Way to Dance: Essays", "ratingValue": "4.57", "authors": "Sejal Shah", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585166374l/53033965.jpg"}, "9780765324641": {"genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Speculative Fiction", "Classics", "Novels", "Novella", "Science Fiction", "Aliens", "War"], "isbn": "9780765324641", "description": "When the inhabitants of a peaceful world are conquered by the bloodthirsty yumens, their existence is irrevocably altered.

Apprentice Medical Officer Jarel wishes that the planet the Imperial Exploration Corps have chosen to colonize didn't have a \"humanoid\" population already living on it. The invaders don't consider the Andrecians to be human and Jarel has seen the atrocious treatment the natives get from his people. How can he make a difference, when he alone regrets the destruction that is people bring? Georyn, the youngest son of a poor Andrecian woodcutter, knows only that there is a terrible dragon on the other side of the enchanted forest, and he is prepared to do whatever it takes to defeat it. In his mind, Elana is the Enchantress from the Stars who has come to test him, to prove he is worthy of defeating the dragon and its powerful minions. Despite both Elana's and Jarel's inner turmoil, Georyn's burden is by far the heaviest. Ultimately, he must pit his innocent faith in the magic of his Enchantress from the Stars against foes who have come from a world beyond his comprehension.", "title": "Enchantress from the Stars", "ratingValue": "3.95", "authors": "Sylvia Engdahl", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361891016l/1450946.jpg"}, "9780142437209": {"genres": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Romance", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Literature", "Gothic", "Historical", "Literature", "19th Century", "Academic", "School", "Classics", "Classic Literature"], "isbn": "9780142437209", "description": "<i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51882399-jane-eyre\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clicca qui per l'edizione \"Storie senza tempo\"</a>.</i><br><br><p>Orphaned as a child, Jane has felt an outcast her whole young life.
