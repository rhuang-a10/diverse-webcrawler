Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken. Shah asks and attempts to answer the question: How do you move in such a way that loss does not limit you? <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> introduces a vital new voice to the conversation about race and belonging in America.", "title": "This Is One Way to Dance: Essays", "ratingValue": "4.57", "authors": "Sejal Shah", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585166374l/53033965.jpg"}, "9780940450745": {"genres": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Novels", "Short Stories", "Literature", "American", "Female Authors", "Literary Fiction", "Literature"], "isbn": "9780940450745", "description": "In her nuanced and sharply etched novels and short stories, Sarah Orne Jewett captured the innerlife and hidden emotional drama of outwardly quiet New England coastal towns. Set against the background of long Maine winters, hardscrabble farms, and the sea, her stories of independent, capable women struggling to find fulfillment in their lives and work have a surprisingly modern resonance. Here is the first collection to include all her best fiction, and it reveals the full stature of the writer Willa Cather ranked with Mark Twain, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Jewett struck her characteristic note in her first collection, Deephaven (1877), stories whose exploration of Maine life moved and delighted readers when they were first published in the Atlantic Monthly, and opened a new vein of regional fiction in American literature. Of the distinctly local quality of her writings Willa Cather later said: \"The language her people speak to each other is a native tongue. No writer can invent it. It is made in the hard school of experience, in communities where language has been undisturbed long enough to take on color and character from the nature and experiences of the people.\" The novel A Country Doctor (1884), inspired by both her own life and that of her doctor father, is often read as a veiled autobiography. Her focus here is on a woman who must choose between marriage and her commitment to a medical career, a decision she defends passionately against the narrowness of those around her: \"God would not give us the same talents if what were right for men were wrong for women.\" Jewett's masterpiece, The Country of the Pointed Firs (1896), brings to imaginative life the faded trading port of Dunnet Landing, Maine, re-creating in spare, impressionistic prose the rhythms and textures of a communal society of poor fishermen and farmers, with its traditional country rituals and its stoically endured tragedies.

In her brief yet fruitful life, she was variously author, editor, literary and social critic, journalist, poet, and revolutionary. She was also one of the few female members of the prestigious Transcendentalist movement, whose ranks included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and many other prominent New England intellectuals of the day. As co-editor of the transcendentalist journal, <i>The Dial</i>, Fuller was able to give voice to her groundbreaking social critique on woman's place in society, the genesis of the book that was later to become <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i>. Published in 1843, this essay was entitled \"The Great Lawsuit: Man versus Men, Woman versus Women.\"<br>First published in book form in 1845, <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i> was correctly perceived as the controversial document that it was: receiving acclaim and achieving popular success in some quarters (the first printing sold out within a week), at the same time that it inspired vicious attacks from opponents of the embryonic women's movement. In this book, whose style is characterized by the trademark textual diversity of the transcendentalists, Fuller articulates values arising from her passionate belief in justice and equality for all humankind, with a particular focus on women. Although her notion of basic rights certainly includes those of an educational, economic, and legal nature, it is intellectual expansion and changes in the prevailing attitudes towards women (by men and women) that Fuller cherishes far above the superficial manifestations of liberation. A classic of feminist thought that helped bring about the Seneca Falls Women's Convention three years after its publication, <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i> inspired her contemporaries Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony to speak of Fuller as possessing \"more influence upon the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time.\"", "title": "Woman in the Nineteenth Century", "ratingValue": "3.63", "authors": "Margaret Fuller", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328867088l/611523.jpg"}, "9780345471727": {"genres": ["Humor", "Nonfiction", "Humor", "Comedy", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Writing", "Essays", "Biography", "Adult", "Biography Memoir", "Parenting", "Classics"], "isbn": "9780345471727", "description": "", "title": "The Grass Is Always Greener over the Septic Tank", "ratingValue": "4.11", "authors": "Erma Bombeck", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347606574l/432288.jpg"}, "9780822208211": {"genres": ["Plays", "Drama", "Plays", "Theatre", "Fiction"], "isbn": "9780822208211", "description": "<div>'<i>night, Mother</i> is a taut and fluid drama that addresses different emotions and special relations.

Her stories of fiercely independent women, culminating in her masterpiece \"The Awakening\" (1899), challenged contemporary mores as much by their sensuousness as their politics, and today seem decades ahead of their time. Now, The Library of America collects all of Chopin's novels and stories as never before in one authoritative volume. <br> The explosive novel \"At Fault\" (1890) centers on a love triangle between a strong-willed young widow, a stiff St. Louis businessman, and the man's alcoholic wife. In the story collections \"Bayou Folk\" (1894) and \"A Night in Acadie\" (1897), Chopin transforms the local color sketch into taut, perfectly calibrated tales of post-Civil War bayou culture. In \"The Awakening,\" the now-classic novel that scandalized many of her contemporaries and effectively ended her writing career, Chopin tells the story of a restless, unsatisfied woman who embarks on a quixotic search for fulfillment. <br> The volume also includes all the stories not collected by Chopin, including those meant for \"A Vocation and a Voice,\" a projected volume that her publisher canceled in 1900, and three stories that were found in 1992 in a long-lost cache of Chopin's papers.", "title": "Complete Novels and Stories", "ratingValue": "4.27", "authors": "Kate Chopin", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309212658l/16077.jpg"}, "9780312424091": {"genres": ["Fiction", "Novels", "Literary Fiction", "Classics", "Literature"], "isbn": "9780312424091", "description": "A modern classic, <i>Housekeeping</i> is the story of Ruth and her younger sister, Lucille, who grow up haphazardly, first under the care of their competent grandmother, then of two comically bumbling great-aunts, and finally of Sylvie, their eccentric and remote aunt.

Born in England and brought up in the household of the Earl of Lincoln where her father, Thomas Dudley, was steward, Anne Bradstreet sailed to Massachusetts Bay in 1630, shortly after her marriage at sixteen to Simon Bradstreet. For the next forty years she lived in the New England wilderness, raising a family of eight, combating sickness and hardship, and writing the verse that made her, as the poet Adrienne Rich says in her Foreword to this edition, \"the first non-didactic American poet, the first to give an embodiment to American nature, the first in whom personal intention appears to precede Puritan dogma as an impulse to verse.\"<br><br>All Anne Bradstreet's extant poetry and prose is published here with modernized spelling and punctuation.

Her later verse and her prose meditations strike a more personal note, however, and reveal both a passionate religious sense and a depth of feeling for her husband, her children, the fears and disappointments she constantly faced, and the consoling power of nature.
