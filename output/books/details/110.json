Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken.

They fail to understand the dynamic of the uprising, the hidden story of its failure, and Washington's part in that tragedy.

Eigentlich hat sich Julia das ja ohnehin schon gedacht, als Mama f\u00fcr ihren kleinen, schleimigen Bruder Olli den wundersch\u00f6nen Adventskalender mit Schokoladenfiguren aus der Tasche zog und ihr, nur weil sie mit neun Jahren angeblich zu alt f\u00fcr Schokoladengeschenke ist, nur ein l\u00e4cherlicher Kalender aus Papier mit einem glitzernden Haus vorne drauf \u00fcbrig bleibt. Und dann verbirgt sich hinter dem ersten T\u00fcrchen auch tats\u00e4chlich ein alberner Dachboden voller Ger\u00fcmpel! Aber trotzdem: Irgend etwas ist besonderes an dem Geschenk der Mutter. Und wirklich entdeckt Julia, dass ihr Adventskalenderhaus voller Leben und voller Geschichten mit K\u00f6nigen, L\u00fcgnern, Zwergen und verlorenen Geheimnissen steckt, in die sie selbst eintauchen und hineinspazieren kann. Und das wird auch f\u00fcr Leser zu einem echten, kunterbunten Vorweihnachts-Vergn\u00fcgen.<p> [image] Richtig bekannt wurde die 47-j\u00e4hrige Illustratorin Cornelia Funke erst, als sie vom Zeichenstift an die Computer-Tastatur \u00fcberwechselte und phantastische Kinderb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Kinder und Erwachsene schrieb. <i>Drachenreiter</i>, <i>Herr der Diebe</i>, <i>Tintenblut</i> und <i>Tintenherz</i> legen hiervon beredtes Zeugnis ab. <i>Hinter verzauberten Fenstern</i> hat im Vergleich zu diesen Mega-Sellern vielleicht die kleinere, stillere Geschichte, ist aber nicht weniger phantasievoll als diese. Und auch hier kommt zum Tragen, dass Funke als Zeichnerin angefangen hat: denn sie zeichnet ihre literarischen Bilder derart lebendig und warm, dass man ihr selbst die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Fiktion dankbar glauben will. <i>Hinter verzauberten Fenstern</i> ist ein wundervoll leises, m\u00e4rchenhaftes Buch, bei dem sich dem Leser hinter jeder Seite eine neue Welt er\u00f6ffnet. Wie bei einem guten Adventskalender eben -- und vor allem bei solchen, die nicht aus Schokolade sind und auf den ersten Blick etwas entt\u00e4uschend wirken. Schade ist da nur, dass es statt 24 nur 16 Kapitel gibt.
