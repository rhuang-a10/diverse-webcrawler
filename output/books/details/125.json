For here, many years earlier, there had been a tragic accident \u2013 the broken body of a woman was discovered on the rocks at the foot of the cliff. This was followed by the grisly discovery of two more bodies \u2013 a husband and wife \u2013 shot dead. But who had killed whom? Was it a suicide pact? A crime of passion? Or cold-blooded murder? Poirot delves back into a crime committed 15 years earlier and discovers that, when there is a distinct lack of physical evidence, it\u2019s just as well that \u2018old sins leave long shadows.'<br><br>This story is part of Agatha Christie\u2019s murder in retrospect series, a collection of stories which look at a crime several years after the fact, piecing together testimonials and witness reports to finally uncover the truth.
