Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken. Shah asks and attempts to answer the question: How do you move in such a way that loss does not limit you? <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> introduces a vital new voice to the conversation about race and belonging in America.", "title": "This Is One Way to Dance: Essays", "ratingValue": "4.57", "authors": "Sejal Shah", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585166374l/53033965.jpg"}, "9780756400439": {"genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Space", "Space Opera", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Speculative Fiction", "War", "Space", "War", "Military Fiction", "Novels"], "isbn": "9780756400439", "description": "<i>In Conquest Born</i> is the monumental science fiction epic that received unprecedented acclaim-and launched C.S.

Were these stories written today, inevitably Jirel would have a lot of hot sex, but as they were first published in <i>Weird Tales</i> between 1934-1939, sexual attraction is mostly only vividly implied. No loss. Jirel's journeys through unnatural landscapes and her battles with supernatural opponents are still wonderful to read, and though newcomers Red Sonja and Xena are more famous now, Jirel rules as the archetypal, indomitable redheaded swordswoman in chain mail and greaves, swinging her \"great two-edged sword.\"<br><br>Contents:<br><br>\u00b7 Jirel Meets Magic \u00b7 nv Weird Tales Jul \u201935 <br>\u00b7 Black God\u2019s Kiss \u00b7 nv Weird Tales Oct \u201934 <br>\u00b7 Black God\u2019s Shadow \u00b7 nv Weird Tales Dec \u201934 <br>\u00b7 The Dark Land \u00b7 nv Weird Tales Jan \u201936 <br>\u00b7 Hellsgarde \u00b7 nv Weird Tales Apr \u201939", "title": "Jirel of Joiry", "ratingValue": "3.76", "authors": "C.L.

A novel of woman and machine, Correspondence blurs the boundaries between virtual reality and real life and examines the interconnectedness of fantasy, desire and memory. More than a novel, Correspondence is a roleplay and you are both reader and narrator, a computer programmer who is a compositor of fantasies. You take your source material from the accumulated hopes and desires of the world, but you must be careful. Sometimes the end result is unexpected. Emotionally deadened by the loss of your family in an accident, you begin turning yourself into a machine; you become an extension of the prosthetics for your compositing work. Soon there will be no future for you, and no past; no emotion and no pain. But your machine consciousness is not yet complete, and from your source material you create Rosa. As she grows and flourishes, Rosa develops a life of her own and starts to distance herself from you. Still deeply connected to the woman you have made, you are left with devastating choices. Subversive and utterly imaginative, Correspondence breaks the boundaries of conventional fiction to explore the meaning of consciousness itself.", "title": "Correspondence", "ratingValue": "3.70", "authors": "Sue Thomas", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348326608l/1101113.jpg"}, "9780312879105": {"genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Dystopia", "War"], "isbn": "9780312879105", "description": "<div>Arslan is a young Asian general who conquers the world in a week without firing a shot and shortly thereafter sets up his headquarters in a small town in Illinois.<br><br>A masterpiece of political science fiction and a book to challenge such works as Ursula K.
