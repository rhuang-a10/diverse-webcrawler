Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken.

The purpose of the series is to make the short fiction of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Ukrainian women writers - early feminists and social activists - accessible to readers of English. The works selected range from vignettes and sketches to novelettes, and together they constitute a compelling social history of an era during which the mortar of social mores, religious beliefs, and gender distinctions began to crumble, wreaking havoc with personal and societal relations. What these authors had in common was an appreciation of the power of literature as a vehicle of social and political activism, and a commitment t o the amelioration of the position of women. Their exploration of gender issue s cuts across ethnic and social divisions, describes the often devastating consequences of social conditioning, and documents both the promise and the human cost of change. The translation of these works permits the message of these women to transcend temporal, geographical, and linguistic boundaries. The first author in Volume I, Olena Pchilka (1849-1930), herself a mother and grandmother from the upper echelons of society, challenged deeply ingrained norms governing the status of women in society, particularly among the privileged and the intellegentsia, and she did so with a tongue-in-cheek humour that makes her writing as delightful as it is informative and purposeful. The second author, Nataliya Kobrynska (1855-1920), was a leading theoretician of feminist thought whose concerns cut across what she saw as the artificial and divisive boundaries of social class. Her husband was as dedicated to the feminist cause as she was, and the couple devoted themselve s to raising the social and political consciousness of women. They urged women of privilege to convince their peasant sisters of the desirability and possibility of social change, established daycare centres and communal kitchens, organized reading circles, and fought for high schools for girls and universal suffrage. Kobrynska was a powerful writer, and her fiction presents a poignantly accurate picture of the social conditions of her day and their devastating effect on women.

Neither won. Nevertheless, her novels have remained classics of Polish literature, and her most famous, On the Niemen, is not only an unusual love story, but is strikingly relevant today. <br><br>Unhappy after being abandoned by her fianc\u00e9, Justyna, an impoverished young woman who lives in a manor house belonging to relatives, desires a life of greater usefulness. While being pursued by a wealthy aristocrat and by her former love \u2013 now married \u2013 she meets Jan, a man of lower social standing, who introduces her to a different world: one of closeness to nature, manual labor, and communal enjoyments. To leave the manor for a farmstead would be a very peculiar proceeding, however, and furthermore, the farming community is feuding with Justyna's uncle. <br><br>Set in the 1880s among the Polish population in a part of what was once the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the story involves the consequences of the January Uprising, twenty years before, against Russian rule. The characters are drawn from a cross section of society and the novel's topics include love, social justice, egotism and materialism, the psychological effects of war, the emancipation of women, marriage as partnership, drug addiction, dignity, obligations to one's fellow humans, what it means to be civilized \u2013 and joy.<br><br>The use of On the Niemen for school literature has unfairly turned generations of Poles against this beautiful story. However, it should be mentioned that readers who dislike detailed descriptions of rural landscapes and late 19th-century interiors will probably not appreciate it. <br><br>As I could not find any other translation into English of this novel, I have translated it myself.

The purpose of the series is to make the short fiction of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Ukrainian women writers - early feminists and social activists - accessible to readers of English. The works selected range from vignettes and sketches to novelettes, and together they constitute a compelling social history of an era during which the mortar of social mores, religious beliefs, and gender distinctions began to crumble, wreaking havoc with personal and societal relations. <p> What these authors had in common was an appreciation of the power of literature as a vehicle of social and political activism, and a commitment to the amelioration of the position of women. Their exploration of gender issues cuts across ethnic and social divisions, describes the often devastating consequences of social conditioning, and documents both the promise and the human cost of change. The translation of these works permits the message of these women to transcend temporal, geographical, and linguistic boundaries. </p><p> The first author, Dniprova Chayka (1861-1927), wrote her short stories under the influence of populism, and they belong to the ethnographic-realistic school of literature. Her publications aroused the ire of the authorities, m any of her manuscripts were confiscated, and some came to light only recently. </p><p> The writing of the second author, Lyubov Yanovska (1861-1933), reflects her deep understanding of and compassion for both the peasantry and the intellegentsia of her time, each caught in the debilitating mores and social structures of their separate worlds. Her works bridge the ethnographic-realistic and the newer modernistic-psychological movement. </p>", "title": "In the Dark of the Night: Selected Short Fiction by Dniprova Chayka and Lyubov Yanovska (Women's Voices in Ukrainian Literature, Vol. II) (Women's voices in Ukrainian literature)", "ratingValue": "3.00", "authors": "Roma Z.

Translated into English for the first time, the novel weaves an engaging tale of manipulation, infatuation, and female assertiveness that takes place one year after the liberation of the empire's serfs. Upending Russian literary clich's of female passivity and rural gentry benightedness, Sofia Khvoshchinskaya centers her story on a commonsense, hardworking noblewoman and her self-assured daughter living on their small rural estate. The antithesis of the thoughtful, intellectual, and self-denying young heroines created by Khvoshchinskaya's male peers, especially Ivan Turgenev, seventeen-year-old Olenka ultimately helps her mother overcome a sense of duty to her \"betters\" and leads the two to triumph over the urbanites' financial, amorous, and matrimonial machinations. Sofia Khvoshchinskaya and her writer sisters closely mirror Britain's Bront?s, yet Khvoshchinskaya's work contains more of Jane Austen's wit and social repartee, as well an intellectual engagement reminiscent of Elizabeth Gaskell's condition-of- England novels.

The purpose of the series is to make the short fiction of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Ukrainian women writers - early feminists and social activists - accessible to readers of English. The works selected range from vignettes and sketches to novelettes, and together they constitute a compelling social history of an era during which the mortar of social mores, religious beliefs, and gender distinctions began to crumble, wreaking havoc with personal and societal relations. <p>What these authors had in common was an appreciation of the power of literature as a vehicle of social and political activism, and a commitment to the amelioration of the position of women. Their exploration of gender issues cuts across ethnic and social divisions, describes the often devastating consequences of social conditioning, and documents both the promise and the human cost of change. The translation of these works permits the message of these women to transcend temporal, geographical, and linguistic boundaries. </p><p>The first author in Volume IV, Oleksandra Sudovshchykova-Kosach (1867 - 1924), is known by her male literary pseudonym, Hrytsko Hryhorenko. She was born in northern Russia, where her parents had been exiled in 1866 for their involvement in Ukrainian organizations. The father died in 1868, and the infant Oleksandra and her mother were allowed to return to Kyiv. After completing high school, Oleksandra joined the Pleyada [The Pleaides], a literary circle promoting Ukrainian literature and introducing Ukrainian readers to foreign authors, and wrote poetry in Ukrainian, Russian and French. In 1893, she married Mykhaylo Kosach, who moved to Estonia to escape political persecution. Oleksandra began writing prose fiction, and in 1898 she published her first collection of realistic ethnographic narratives about peasant life. After Kosach's death in 1903, the young widow and her daughter lived with the Kosach family while Oleksandra completed a law degree. Writing in a modern, impressionistic style, she broadened her themes to include stories about the intelligentsia, and explored the concept of psychological individualism. The greater part of her literary legacy consists of works documenting the harsh conditions and moral decay of peasant life at the turn of the century, and to detailing the desperate measures to which the peasants, especially the women, were driven by adversity. She wrote with such brutal honesty that critics and readers of her day accused her of dwelling solely on the dark side of life. Her later writing, in which she examined the impact of technological and social change on individuals from all levels of society, was no less moving and candid. </p><p>The second author is Lesya Ukrainka (1871 - 1913), the literary pseudonym of Larysa Kosach-Kvitka. Her parents were Olha Drahomanova-Kosach (literary pseudonym: Olena Pchilka), a writer in Eastern Ukraine, and Petro Kosach, a senior civil servant. In addition to Ukrainian, Larysa learned Russian, Polish, Bulgarian, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, German, and English. She began writing poetry at the age of nine, and at 13 saw her first poem published under the name Lesya Ukrainka. When she was seventeen, she and her brother organized a literary circle called Pleyada [The Pleiades] to promote Ukrainian literature and translate classics into Ukrainian. Lesya published her first collection of lyrical poetry, On Wings of Songs, in 1893, a year after her translations of Heine's poetry, The Book of Songs, appeared. Ukrainian publications were banned in the Russian Empire so both books were published in Western Ukraine and smuggled into Kyiv. Ukrainka wrote epic poems, prose dramas, prose, literary criticism, and sociopolitical essays. In her dramatic poems, her greatest legacy to Ukrainian literature, she developed the themes of national freedom, dignity, and personal integrity, and called on people the world over to throw off the yoke of oppression. In 1907, she married the ethnographer and musicologist Klyment Kvitka. Upon her death at 42 after a lifelong struggle with tuberculosis of the bone, Ukrainka left behind a rich and diversified literary legacy. While it is the deep philosophical thought and the perfection of her poetic form that have assured her place in world literature, her prose works provide a fascinating insight into the inner life of this gifted, multifaceted writer, and reveal her perceptions of the multi-layered society in which she lived.</p>", "title": "From Heart to Heart : Selected prose fiction by Hrytsko Hryhorenko and Lesya Ukrainka (Women's Voices in Ukrainian Literature Vol. IV)", "ratingValue": "5.00", "authors": "Hrytsko Hryhorenko", "imgUrl": ""}, "9781401229597": {"genres": ["Sequential Art", "Graphic Novels", "Sequential Art", "Comics", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Nonfiction", "History", "Cultural", "Poland"], "isbn": "9781401229597", "description": "\u201cI am Marzi, born in 1979, ten years before the end of communism in Poland.
