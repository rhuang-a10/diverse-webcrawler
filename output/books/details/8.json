Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence.

In today's world, women have more power, legal recognition, and professional success than ever before. Alongside the evident progress of the women's movement, however, writer and journalist Naomi Wolf is troubled by a different kind of social control, which, she argues, may prove just as restrictive as the traditional image of homemaker and wife. It's the beauty myth, an obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope, self-consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society's impossible definition of \"the flawless beauty.\"", "title": "The Beauty Myth", "ratingValue": "3.90", "authors": "Naomi Wolf", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388197585l/39926.jpg"}, "9781324001874": {"genres": ["Politics", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "History", "Economics", "Audiobook"], "isbn": "9781324001874", "description": "<p>\n  <strong>A multigenerational saga of two families, who rose from immigrant roots to the pinnacle of wealth and power, that tracks the unraveling of American democracy.</strong>\n</p><p>In <em>American Oligarchs</em>, award-winning investigative journalist Andrea Bernstein tells the story of the Trump and Kushner families like never before.

Excerpt: Double Persephone is a poetry collection written by Canadian author Margaret Atwood in 1961. The book comprises seven poems. It was the first publication ever released by Atwood. In the opening poem of Double Persephone, a \"girl with the gorgon touch\" walks through a formal garden searching for \"a living wrist and arm\". However all she finds is a \"a line of statues\" with \"marble flesh.\" This \"gorgon\" is apparently Medusa, whose glance turned men to stone. In the concluding poem of Atwood's most recent collection of new work, You Are Happy, another male figure appears with similarly sculptural qualities: However this statue comes to life, out of the worlds of art and ritual and into that of flesh: In the seven books of poems Atwood develops an intricate balance between the mythological, or the sculptural and the kinetic, and the actual, and the temporal. Atwood's consideration of this opposition has been simultaneously ethical and aesthetic; all attitudes toward form in her work have been subject to moral judgments. The sources of this antithesis lie in the earliest days of Anglo-American modernism with its deepest roots in T. E. Hulme's rejection of nineteenth-century empathetic realism. The formal garden depicted in the Double Persophone poetry can be created and entered, but its marble flesh cannot be lifted from still dance into dancing life. Atwood followed up the collection with another book of poetry released in 1964, The Circle Game. ...
