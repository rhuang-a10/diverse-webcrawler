Schizophrenia is not a single unifying diagnosis, and Esm\u00e9 Weijun Wang writes not just to her fellow members of the \"collected schizophrenias\" but to those who wish to understand it as well. Opening with the journey toward her diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, Wang discusses the medical community's own disagreement about labels and procedures for diagnosing those with mental illness, and then follows an arc that examines the manifestations of schizophrenia in her life. In essays that range from using fashion to present as high-functioning to the depths of a rare form of psychosis, and from the failures of the higher education system and the dangers of institutionalization to the complexity of compounding factors such as PTSD and Lyme disease, Wang's analytical eye, honed as a former lab researcher at Stanford, allows her to balance research with personal narrative.

Although born in Poland, Rose, now in her twenties came to the United States with her father, Mordechai, at the age of four and is now completely \"Americanized.\" The plan had been for Rose's mother and sister to join the others, but the sister fell ill with scarlet fever, the mother stayed on to care for her, and soon the rise of the Nazis cut off their escape. Their ordeal in the concentration camps, which only the sister survived, has brought a burden of guilt to the aging Mordechai and deeply mixed feelings as he awaits the arrival of his elder daughter, Lusia, who has, at last, found her way to America. With her halting English and old world ways Luisa is a striking contrast to Rose, who is somewhat embarrassed by her rediscovered sister's presence, and fearful that it will threaten her own hard-won independence. Distraught, and concerned that she may never be reunited with her young husband, Lusia embraces a series of memories and fantasies which make real the joys and horrors of her life before the war, from which her father and sister were spared. But when Mordechai gives Rose a letter from her mother\u0097a letter left many years earlier with a non-Jewish Polish friend\u0097a \"proof\" of family is somehow restored, and old barriers and griefs give way to a renewed sense of hope and mutual dependence\u0097and the conviction that a better future may yet arise from the bitter ashes of the troubled past.</p>", "title": "A Shayna Maidel", "ratingValue": "3.91", "authors": "Barbara Lebow", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266919511l/1889072.jpg"}, "9781783199051": {"genres": [], "isbn": "9781783199051", "description": "", "title": "Jane Eyre", "ratingValue": "4.18", "authors": "the Jane Eyre Company", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527118598l/40201090._SY475_.jpg"}, "9780735220621": {"genres": ["Politics", "History", "Nonfiction", "Northern Africa", "Egypt"], "isbn": "9780735220621", "description": "<b>A candid narrative of how and why the Arab Spring sparked, then failed, and the truth about America's role in that failure and the subsequent military coup that put Sisi in power--from the Middle East correspondent of the <i>New York Times</i>.</b><br><br>In 2011, Egyptians of all sects, ages, and social classes shook off millennia of autocracy, then elected a Muslim Brother as president. The 2013 military coup replaced him with a new strongman, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has cracked down on any dissent or opposition with a degree of ferocity Mubarak never dared. <i>New York Times</i> correspondent David D. Kirkpatrick arrived in Egypt with his family less than six months before the uprising first broke out in 2011, looking for a change from life in Washington, D.C. As revolution and violence engulfed the country, he received an unexpected and immersive education in the Arab world.<br><br>For centuries, Egypt has set in motion every major trend in politics and culture across the Middle East, from independence and Arab nationalism to Islamic modernism, political Islam, and the jihadist thought that led to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Arab Spring revolts of 2011 spread from Cairo, and now Americans understandably look with cynical exasperation at the disastrous Egyptian experiment with democracy. They fail to understand the dynamic of the uprising, the hidden story of its failure, and Washington's part in that tragedy. In this candid narrative, Kirkpatrick lives through Cairo's hopeful days and crushing disappointments alongside the diverse population of his new city: the liberal yuppies who first gathered in Tahrir Square; the persecuted Coptic Christians standing guard around Muslims at prayer during the protests; and the women of a grassroots feminism movement that tried to seize its moment. Juxtaposing his on-the-ground experience in Cairo with new reporting on the conflicts within the Obama administration, Kirkpatrick traces how authoritarianism was allowed to reclaim Egypt after thirty months of turmoil.<br><br><i>Into the Hands of the Soldiers</i> is a heartbreaking story with a simple message: The failings of decades of autocracy are the reason for the chaos we see today across the Arab world. Because autocracy is the problem, more autocracy is unlikely to provide a durable solution. Egypt, home to one in four Arabs, is always a bellwether. Understanding its recent history is essential to understanding everything taking place across the region today--from the terrorist attacks in the North Sinai and Egypt's new partnership with Israel to the bedlam in Syria and Libya.", "title": "Into the Hands of the Soldiers: Freedom and Chaos in Egypt and the Middle East", "ratingValue": "4.31", "authors": "David D.

Asking for resistance and sabotage of the war effort, among other things, they published their thoughts in five separate anonymous leaflets, which they titled \"The White Rose\" and which were distributed throughout Germany and Austria during the summer of 1942 and the winter of 1943. When captured, the police inspector of the town, Robert Mohr, is intrigued by Sophie, the youngest of the conspirators and the only girl among them. Mohr, who doesn't really take the crime of passing leaflets so seriously, knows that the Third Reich does and is pressured by a superior, Mahler, to obtain a conviction. Mohr wants to save Sophie from certain execution and tries to get her to sign a confession saying that she didn't know what she was doing and that she was misled by the others. But Sophie counters with why she is fighting for what is right, the meaning of pride and when it counts and the loyalty she feels to the others, especially her brother who is a leader in the group. The conversations between Sophie and Mohr and the interrogation scenes of the other conspirators reveal a complex group of people, all clinging to beliefs that ultimately can not be fulfilled at this point in time. In the end, all in The White Rose group are executed, and the Nazi regime continues its devastation until the end of World War II.", "title": "The White Rose", "ratingValue": "4.18", "authors": "Lillian Groag", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266883612l/1747523.jpg"}, "9780385603102": {"genres": ["Horror", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Novels", "Contemporary", "Literature", "Adult", "Fantasy", "Paranormal"], "isbn": "9780385603102", "description": "Years ago, when <i>House of Leaves</i> was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet.
