Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence.

McBride constructs a groundbreaking theology of public witness for Protestant church communities in the United States. In contrast to the triumphal manner in which many Protestants have engaged the public sphere, The Church for the World shows how the church can offer a nontriumphal witness to the lordship of Christ through repentant activity in public life. <br>After investigating current Christian conceptions of witness in the United States, McBride offers a new theology for repentance as public witness, based on Bonhoeffer's thought concerning Christ, the world, and the church. McBride takes up Bonhoeffer's proposal that repentance may be reinterpreted \"non-religiously,\" expanding and challenging common understandings of the concept. Finally, she examines two church communities that exemplify ecclesial commitments and practices rooted in confession of sin and repentance. Through these communities she demonstrates that confession and repentance may be embodied in various ways yet also discerns distinguishing characteristics of a redemptive public witness. <br>The Church for the World offers important insights about Christian particularity and public engagement in a pluralistic society as it provides a theological foundation for public witness that is simultaneously bold and humble: when its mode of being in the world is confession of sin unto repentance, the church demonstrates Christ's redemptive work and becomes a vehicle of concrete redemption.", "title": "The Church for the World: A Theology of Public Witness", "ratingValue": "4.29", "authors": "Jennifer McBride", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327993025l/13375171.jpg"}, "9780718092825": {"genres": ["Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Spirituality", "Christian", "Christian Living"], "isbn": "9780718092825", "description": "<strong>What if our truest life is the one right in front of us?</strong><br><br>Does life sometimes seem to be passing you by?

While suffering the terror of physical annihilation decreed by the Final Solution, these Jews had to contend with their exclusion from the world that they considered theirs. On yet another level, this study of four extraordinary life stories contributes to a deeper understanding of the postwar development of ethical, theological, and feminist thought. In showing concern about a world that had ceased to care for them, Stein, Weil, Frank, and Hillesum demonstrated that the meaning of human existence consisted in the responsibility for the other, in the protection of the suffering God, in the primary value of relatedness through empathy. Arguing that their ethical tenets anticipated the thought of such postwar thinkers as Levinas, Fackenheim, Tillich, Arendt, and Nodding, Brenner proposes that the breakup of the humanist tradition of the Enlightenment in the Holocaust engendered the postwar exploration of humanist potential in self-givenness to the other.", "title": "Writing as Resistance: Four Women Confronting the Holocaust: Edith Stein, Simone Weil, Anne Frank, Etty Hillesum", "ratingValue": "3.33", "authors": "Rachel Feldhay Brenner", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347796795l/105615.jpg"}, "9781620326244": {"genres": ["Religion", "Theology", "Leadership", "Religion", "Christian"], "isbn": "9781620326244", "description": "Here is the long-awaited volume that provides both the theoretical foundations and practical guidance for developing new monastic and missional communities in contexts that are theologically progressive, racially and economically diverse, and multicultural.

Amid the rising tide of discontent, the public debates\u2014including the \u201dculture wars\u201d\u2014seem to be a mere spinning of wheels.In a penetrating analysis of our times, Charlene Spretnak asserts that both the liberal and conservative sides in those debates are situated in the very orientation that created the modern crisis: the mechanistic worldview with <i>Homo economicus</i> at the center. The grand claims of modernity no longer inspire confidence because its destructive effects seem to be multiplying. The author, an influential public intellectual, speaks poignantly to our growing sense of what has been lost and what is slipping away.Yet Charlene Spretnak argues persuasively that the intensification of the modern crises is not inevitable and is already being challenged by an impressive network of corrective efforts. The new acceptance of holistic medicine (forced by the healthcare crisis, the new understandings in science of nature's powers of dynamic creativity and self-organization, the new political opposition of community-based activists to the forces of globalization, and the new surge of independence efforts by ancient nations that have been devoured by modern states\u2014all are part of an emergent value system that counters the modern conception of liberty as a flight from body, nature and place.After identifying \u201depochal rumblings\u201d embedded in the nightly news in the 1990s, Charlene Spretnak illuminates the sources of the modern condition with exceptional clarity. Moreover, she reframes \u201dthe <i> other </i> history\u201d of the modern era: the ecospiritual lineage of movements that resisted the corrosive effects of the industrialized modern world. These include the Arts and Crafts movement, the cosmological schools of painting, the stream of Modernist writers and artists who did not embrace the \u201dmachine aesthetic\u201d after World War One, and Gandhi's \u201dConstructive Program.\u201d The grassroots movements today that are forging a new politics of local and regional revitalization beyond left-and-right are heir to a rich tradition, to which the author brings original interpretations.Finally, Charlene Spretnak concludes her wideranging exploration with an engaging story of an American heartland city in the near future that has largely decoupled from the destructive dynamics of the globalized economy and initiated a range of pragmatic alternatives in its region.Both a sharp critique and a graceful performance of the art of the possible, <i>The Resurgence of the Real</i> changes the way we thing about living in the modern world.", "title": "The Resurgence Of The Real: Body, Nature, And Place In A Hypermodern World", "ratingValue": "3.75", "authors": "Charlene Spretnak", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266701707l/2287304.jpg"}, "9781091165427": {"genres": ["Parenting"], "isbn": "9781091165427", "description": "", "title": "The Genius Mind of an Anti-Vaxxer: Truth Unleashed", "ratingValue": "4.96", "authors": "Sharon Storm", "imgUrl": ""}, "9781587430404": {"genres": ["Religion", "Theology", "Spirituality", "Womens", "Religion"], "isbn": "9781587430404", "description": "Botox.

It's the beauty myth, an obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope, self-consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society's impossible definition of \"the flawless beauty.\"", "title": "The Beauty Myth", "ratingValue": "3.90", "authors": "Naomi Wolf", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388197585l/39926.jpg"}, "9780830843909": {"genres": ["Christian", "Social Issues", "Religion", "Faith", "Religion", "Theology", "Race", "Self Help", "Personal Development"], "isbn": "9780830843909", "description": "We can see evidence of injustice all around us, whether in continuing incidents of racial inequality or in the systemic forces that disenfranchise people and perpetuate poverty.

This radical book develops the notion of covenant epistemology--an innovative, biblically compatible, holistic, embodied, life-shaping epistemological vision in which all knowing takes the shape of interpersonal, covenantal relationship. Rather than knowing in order to love, we love in order to know. Meek argues that all knowing is best understood as transformative encounter. Creatively blending insights from a diverse range of conversation partners--including Michael Polanyi, Michael D. Williams, Lesslie Newbigin, Parker Palmer, John Macmurray, Martin Buber, and James Loder--Meek offers critically needed \"epistemological therapy\" in response to the pervasive and damaging presumptions that those in Western culture continue to bring to efforts to know. The book's innovative approach--an unfolding journey of discovery-through-dialogue--itself subverts standard epistemological presumptions of timeless linearity. While it offers a sustained and sophisticated philosophical argument, Loving to Know's texts and textures interweave loosely to effect therapeutic epistemic transformation in the reader. Endorsements: \"Nobody acquainted with philosophical epistemology would associate it with eloquence or passion. So Loving to Know is extraordinary, because this is epistemology presented with both eloquence and passion, addressed to the person 'on the street' but at the same time raising issues that professional philosophers should take account of. In a most creative way, Professor Meeks takes Michael Polanyi's epistemology, which she perceptively and lucidly summarizes, into new terrain. She argues that to come to know as we ought to come to know is to keep covenant. It is to be faithful both to the known and to oneself, the knower. So take and read. And when you do, you will learn that how the book came about is itself an example of the theory, as is the innovative structure of the discussion. The formation and presentation of the theory display the theory.\" --Nicholas Wolterstorff Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology Yale University \"Esther Meek has given a good gift in Loving to Know, continuing her lifelong reflections on a more human and truthful understanding of knowledge. Drawing on the best of scholarship, she is her own scholar too, offering a unique vision of a covenant epistemology, a way of knowing that is deeply personal and responsible, because it is profoundly relational. A book for every one of us, as we take up the most perennial of human questions, viz. what will we do with what we know?\" --Steven Garber Director The Washington Institute \"This book is a tour de force of clarity, depth, and compelling wisdom. Esther Meek argues that we become what we love and that if we love truth then we must love to engage in the interpersonal dialogue of seeing the world well through the prism of another's heart. Her premise is lived out through dialogue with a range of authors that makes my head spin. She seizes their wisdom and yet pursues it further to the person of Christ than any I have read. This is an epistemologically therapeutic embrace of how to live well in the world of divergent thought that nevertheless longs to reveal Jesus as the center of all true wisdom. It is a breathtaking and beautiful labor.\" --Dan B.

The main difference lies in the methodology: Maggay focuses strongly on Scripture in building a case for social involvement and in evaluating possible approaches; the Catholic would look also to the body of social thought developed by the Popes over the past 100 years or so. Yet for the Catholic the emphasis on Scripture can itself be refreshing and stimulating, and an incentive to dialogue with the Evangelical tradition. --The book makes other interesting contributions as well. It brings to the fore the ferment now taking place within the Philippine Evangelical churches. And it offers useful reflections on attitudes and strategies, dangers and traps in the arena of social involvement. In particular it offers a timely reminder to keep our focus on God and His work in the world, in the midst of our own 'worldly' involvement. Finally, it all rings true as coming from one who has been deeply involved in that same work.-- --Fr. Bienvenido F. Nebres, SJ President, Ateneo de Manila University --Dr. Melba Maggay writes on the Church as an agent for transforming society from her experience of Martial Law and her participation in the 1986 EDSA Revolution. She disavows being a theologian but she only means she is not an academic theologian! Or perhaps that she is not a dogmatic/systematic theologian. Despite her disavowal, what we have in this book is an outstanding piece of theological writing on the task of the Church in the world, particularly in Philippine society. She has no simple solutions to complex social situations. But she dares to dream because she knows that the Kingdom of God has come, and will yet come in blazing splendor when King Jesus returns. Meanwhile, in her words, she is 'one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread to sustain the journey towards liberation and social justice and righteousness.' I commend these essays wholeheartedly.-- --Dr. Isabelo F. Magalit President, Asian Theological Seminary --Transforming Society is the kind of book one could put into the hands of a senator, a human rights lawyer, a journalist with a political conscience and a community development worker, whether they are Christians or not, The better they were not, for non-Christians might better understand the passion and pain of Melba Maggay's writing than triumphalistic Christians with their ready made answers to a superficial assessment of society's problems. --She is writing as a social activist who has taken time to reflect on Scripture and theological tradition in order to make better sense of the Christian's role in society . . . Her involvement in working for justice in the Philippines leading to the euphoric EDSA 'revolution' gives the book concrete particularity. Her reflections on Scripture and the role of the church give the book usable generality for other social contexts and for other times. --Transforming Society is written in a bitter-sweet note. There is no frothy idealism in this book. But neither is it pessimistic. Instead a wary realism is reflected throughout its pages . . . Its lyrical language will inspire. Its sound concepts will provide direction. Its realism will help in being credible. Its hope is Christological. The overall impact of this book will be both challenging and prophetic. --Melba Maggay is undoubtedly the finest protestant theological writer in the Philippines, and possibly in the Third World . . .-- --Charles Ringma, PhD Professor, Asian Theological Seminary and founder of Tee", "title": "Transforming Society", "ratingValue": "4.30", "authors": "Melba Padilla Maggay", "imgUrl": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347334779l/11959110.jpg"}, "B00AFWH8F8": {"genres": [], "isbn": "B00AFWH8F8", "description": "In this era of \"life makeovers,\" personal coaches, and success-oriented mission statements, many people are working hard to get it together.
