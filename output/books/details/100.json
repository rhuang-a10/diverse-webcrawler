Wimsey goes undercover and discovers that Dean was part of the fast crowd at Pym's, a group taken to partying and doing drugs.

Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya.

As those who have heard Miss Sayer's lectures on Dante can testify, she brings to the interpretation of the Divine Comedy a vitalizing power of analysis and re-creation. Readers of Dante often become discouraged by the mass of factual detail which the older school of historical criticism has made available; mere aestheticism, however, unrelated to the time and space, is nor likely to satisfy them either. They will find in Miss Sayers' essays enough scholarly assistance to put themselves in the position of a contemporary reader; but their attention will chiefly be drawn to the relevance of the Divine Comedy to our present day world and way of life. Miss Sayers' emphasis on the ethical, rather than on the aesthetic, or historical, significance of Dante's work, comes as a welcome and bracing challenge to the confusion regarding values, whether of literature or of life, which characterizes the present age.", "title": "Introductory Papers on Dante, Volume 1: The Poet Alive in His Writings", "ratingValue": "4.29", "authors": "Dorothy L.

Sayers is that she wrote \"real\" novels. Catherine Kenney considers why Sayers mysteries tend to strike astute readers this way, and in so doing, suggests her place not only in the history of detection, but in the larger tradition of the English novel which she admired. <em>Gaudy Night</em>, for example, bears striking similarities to nineteenth-century English fiction, especially the novels of Jane Austen. The links between these authors have important implications not only for literary and social history, but also for our growing understanding of the subtle relationship between gender and genre.<br><br>Unlike earlier book-length studies of Sayers, what Professor Kenney has written is not a biography or a survey, but an assessment of Dorothy Sayer's main contributions to modern letters and culture. Drawing upon Sayer's novels, essays, plays, manuscripts, and letters, Kenney demonstrates the organic relationship of the parts of Sayer's canon and argues persuasively that all of her important themes and concerns are embedded in her best work, her fiction.<br><br>Sayer's three main accomplishments serve as the organizing principle of this book: first, her transformation of the modern detective story into a serious novel of social criticism and moral depth; second, her penetrating critique of the situation of modern women; and finally her compelling work as a lay theologian and interpreter of Christianity. Thus, the book proceeds not only in roughly chronological order, but also from the work that most readers know best what they know least. The author assumes some familiarity with Sayer's fiction, but <em>The Remarkable Case of Dorothy L. Sayers</em> is not intended for specialists alone.

Sayers</i>, edited by Barbara Reynolds, covers the seven years in which the greatest detective novelist of the golden age turns away from mystery writing to become a playwright and, in turn, a controversial figure. As such, it bears little mention of Lord Peter but further illumination into the inspirations of his creator. There is some coverage of the Wimsey family papers and the play version of <i>Busman's Honeymoon</i>, but the bulk of this second volume deals with the groundbreaking set of religious plays that Sayers wrote for the BBC, including a fascinating contretemps over the BBC's attempts to edit her. This volume provides considerable insight into a formidable intellect and a sparkling writer.", "title": "The Letters of Dorothy L. Sayers.
