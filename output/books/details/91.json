Throughout the collection, Shah reflects on what it means to make oneself visible and legible through writing in a country that struggles with race and maps her identity as an American, South Asian American, writer of color, and feminist. <i>This Is One Way to Dance</i> draws on Shah's ongoing interests in ethnicity and place: the geographic and cultural distances between people, both real and imagined. Her memoir in essays emerges as Shah wrestles with her experiences growing up and living in western New York, an area of stark racial and economic segregation, as the daughter of Gujarati immigrants from India and Kenya. These essays also trace her movement over twenty years from student to teacher and meditate on her travels and life in New England, New York City, and the Midwest, as she considers what it means to be of a place or from a place, to be foreign or familiar.<br><br><br><br>Shah invites us to consider writing as a somatic practice, a composition of digressions, repetitions--movement as transformation, incantation. Her essays--some narrative, others lyrical and poetic--explore how we are all marked by culture, gender, and race; by the limits of our bodies, by our losses and regrets, by who and what we love, by our ambivalences, and by trauma and silence. Language fractures in its attempt to be spoken.

The plot is simple: Amy Norton comes home for a week\u2019s visit to her hometown in Michigan (the town is unnamed but must owe a lot to Albion, where Helen Hull grew up): \u2018Now that she was back in the town of her childhood, standing on a corner across from the village triangle of green, a small pyramid of luggage at her feet, Amy\u2019s one clear thought, over the fluttering of unimportant recognitions, was \u201cWhy on earth have I come?\u201d\u2019 Her husband has gone on holiday without her, her two children are at summer camp, and she is hoping to work out why she is unhappy. She looks with detached eyes at every member of the Westover family, all of whom live within striking distance of their old home; and, having been away for so long, is able to observe her female relations with fresh eyes and to see that \u2018each of them lived true to her own code, without conflict or rebellion. And I \u2013 Amy moved restlessly \u2013 I don\u2019t know what my code is.\u2019 Yet, over the course of the sultry summer week, with flashes of lightning never far away, she starts to understand herself better and to have a new insight into the lives of her relations: the matriarchal \u2018Madam Westover\u2019 her grandmother; her parents Alfred and Catherine; her brother and sister Ted and Mary, who has just given birth to another child; and her aunt and her two unmarried children. As Amy comes to realise, the Westover family, into which \u2018foreigners\u2019 have married, is a microcosm of the larger society, each member with his own code, derived blindly from distant soil.\u2019 The result, which is what Helen Hull is describing, is that \u2018the individual has nothing firm upon which he can lean, nor has he even any definite way of life against which he can rebel: he is under the necessity of determining for himself how he shall act and think.\u2019<br><br>It is the summer after the Great Crash of 1929 and, as in so many Persephone books, everything happens and nothing happens; however, a book which is simply about family life turns out to be unputdownable. \u2018Although Heat Lightning focuses on domestic life,\u2019 writes the American academic Patricia McClelland Miller in her Persephone Preface, \u2018it is, at its core, a novel of ideas, even though not all of the book\u2019s readers would have recognised it as such.\u2019 Indeed, the book with which most Persephone readers will compare it is Dorothy Whipple\u2019s Greenbanks. \u2018Like Dorothy Whipple, Helen Hull\u2019s perception, her clarity of expression and her ability to tease out the quiet, unspoken thoughts and fears that ripple under the surface of each of our lives is magnificent,\u2019 wrote Rachel of Book Snob, adding, \u2018it takes true skill to rivet the heart and mind while remaining within the four walls of the family home, and I can\u2019t praise Helen Hull\u2019s abilities enough.\u2019", "title": "Heat Lightning", "ratingValue": "3.70", "authors": "Helen R.
